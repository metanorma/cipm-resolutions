    that the following transition frequencies shall be included or updated in the list of recommended standard frequencies:
    
    the unperturbed optical transition 5s^2^ ^1^S~0~ – 5s 5p ^3^P~0~ of the ^87^Sr neutral atom with a frequency of f = 429 228 004 229 873.7 Hz and a relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1 xx 10^(−15)] (this radiation is already endorsed by the CIPM as a secondary representation of the second);
