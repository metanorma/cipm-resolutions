    that
    
    improved frequency values for radiations of some high-stability cold ion standards already documented in the recommended radiations list have recently become available;

    date_effective: 2003-01-01
    message: femtosecond comb-based frequency measurements for certain iodine gas-cell standards on the subsidiary recommended source list have recently been made for the first time, leading to significantly reduced uncertainty;

  - type: proposes
    date_effective: 2003-01-01
    message: |-
    that the _recommended radiation_ list be revised to include the following:
    
    updated frequency values for the single trapped ^88^Sr^\+^ ion quadrupole transition and the single trapped ^171^Yb^+^ octupole transition;
  - type: proposes
    date_effective: 2003-01-01
    message: an updated frequency value for the C~2~H~2~-stabilized standard at stem:[1.54 " "mu"m"];
  - type: proposes
    date_effective: 2003-01-01
    message: updated frequency values for the I~2~-stabilized standards at 543 nm and 515 nm.
