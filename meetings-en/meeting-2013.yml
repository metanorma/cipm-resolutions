    the following changes to the list of "Recommended values of standard frequencies for applications including the practical realization of the metre and secondary representations of the second":
    
    that the following transition frequency be added to the list:
    
    * the unperturbed optical transition 6s^2^ ^1^S~0~ – 6s 6p ^3^P~0~ of the ^199^Hg neutral atom with a frequency of 1 128 575 290 808 162 Hz and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1.7 xx 10^(−14)];

    that the following transition frequencies be updated in the list:
    
    * the unperturbed optical transition 4s ^2^S~1/2~ – 3d ^2^D~5/2~ of the ^40^Ca^+^ ion with a frequency of 411 042 129 776 395 Hz and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1.5 xx 10^(−14)];
    * the unperturbed optical transition 1S – 2S of the ^1^H neutral atom with a frequency of 1 233 030 706 593 518 Hz and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1.2 xx 10^(−14)];
    
    Note: This frequency corresponds to half of the energy difference between the 1S and 2S states;

    that the following transition frequency be updated as a secondary representation of the second:
    
    * the unperturbed ground - state hyperfine transition of ^87^Rb with a frequency of 6 834 682 610.904 312 Hz and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1.3 xx 10^(−15)].
    
    Note: The value of the estimated standard uncertainty is assumed to correspond to a confidence level of 68 %. However, given the very limited number of available data there is a possibility that in hindsight this might not prove to be exact.
