    that the following transition frequencies shall be included in the list of recommended values of standard frequencies:
    
    * Absorbing molecule ^127^I~2~, saturated absorption a~1~ component, R(36) 32-0 transition.
    
    The values:: stem:[f_(a1) = 564 074 632.42 " MHz"] +
    stem:[lambda_(a1) = 531 476 582.65 " fm"]
    
    with an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1 xx 10^(−10)] apply to the radiation of a frequency-doubled diode DFB laser, stabilized with an iodine cell external to the laser.
    
    * Absorbing atom ^87^Rb 5S~1/2~ - 5P~3/2~ crossover between the d and f hyperfine components of the saturated absorption at 780 nm (D2 transition)
    
    The values:: stem:[f_("d/f crossover") = 384 227 981.9 " MHz"] +
    stem:[lambda_("d/f crossover") = 780 246 291.6 " fm"]
    
    with an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[5 xx 10^(−10)] apply to the radiation of a tunable External Cavity Diode Laser, stabilized to the d/f crossover in a rubidium cell external to the laser.
    
    Note: The value of the standard uncertainty is assumed to correspond to a confidence level of 68 %. However, given the limited availability of data there is a possibility that in hindsight this might not prove to be exact
